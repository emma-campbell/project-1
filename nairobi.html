          <h3>Welcome to Nairobi!</h3>
          <p>
            Nairobi is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes
            from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to "cool
            water", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the
            city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019
            census, while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580.
            The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun. East
            Africa's most cosmopolitan city, Nairobi is Kenya's beating heart,
            an exciting, maddening concrete jungle that jarringly counterpoints
            the untrammelled natural beauty to be found elsewhere in the
            country.
          </p>

            Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British
            East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly
            grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After
            independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of
            Kenya. During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a centre for
            the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry.The city lies in the
            south central part of Kenya, at an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889
            ft).

          <h3>Delectable Cuisines</h3>
          <h4>Sukuma Wiki</h4>
          <p>
            Sukuma wiki, a Swahili phrase which literally means "to push the
            week", is a simple dish made with greens similar to kale or collards
            that can also be made with cassava leaves, sweet potato leaves, or
            pumpkin leaves. Its Swahili name comes from the fact that it is
            typically eaten to "get through the week" or "stretch the week".
          </p>

          <h4>Nyama Choma</h4>
          <p>
            Nyama choma is grilled meat, which can be considered as an
            unofficial national dish – usually goat or sheep - while kuku choma
            is grilled chicken. It is usually cooked over an open fire. It is
            usually eaten with ugali and kachumbari, maharagwe (bean stew) and
            mchicha (shredded spinach).
          </p>

          <h4>Ugali</h4>
          <p>
            The undeniable most common Kenyan food staple is ugali – usually
            made from cornmeal that is added to boiling water and heated until
            it turns into a dense block of cornmeal paste. Ugali has the
            consistency of a grainy dough and the heaviness of a brick. For many
            Kenyans, ugali along with a small amount of cooked vegetables or
            saucy stew is a normal meal.

          <h3>Attractions Worth Traveling For</h3>
          <h4>Nairobi National Park</h4>
          <p>
            Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was
            established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is
            fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows
            migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent
            Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry
            season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing
            human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of
            wildlife. Despite its proximity to the city and its relative small
            size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one
            of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.
          </p>

          <h4>Nairobi National Museum</h4>
          <p>
            The National Museum in Nairobi is an educational way to spend a few
            hours on a city stopover. The museum displays diverse cultural and
            natural history exhibits including more than 900 stuffed birds and
            mammals, fossils from Lake Turkana, ethnic displays from various
            Kenyan tribal groups, and exhibits of local art.
          </p>
          <h4>Bomas of Kenya</h4>
          <p>
            About 10 kilometers from Nairobi, Bomas of Kenya is a living museum
            celebrating the colorful tribes of Kenya. This is a great place to
            learn about the lifestyle, art, music, crafts, and culture of each
            tribe. The complex encompasses a recreated traditional village with
            homesteads or bomas, each one reflecting the culture of a major
            ethnic group. Every afternoon, a team performs traditional dances
            and songs in the large theater. Audience participation makes the
            performances even more enjoyable.
