 				<h3>Welcome to Egypt!</h3>
		 			<p>Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient monuments in the world. It is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE), recent excavations on the plateau have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers' quarters. </p>

		 			<p>Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8 million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the Greater Cairo metropolis.</p>

		 		<h3>Experience the Culture</h3>
		 			<p>In a similar manner, in Egypt’s Middle Kingdom, the Pyramids at Giza acquired cultural significance during the Middle Kingdom, as artifacts of the “golden age.” The cultural memory of the Old Kingdom didn't overwhelm the Middle Kingdom, but the Old Kingdom was viewed as Egypt's "golden age." This veneration of the past continued throughout the New Kingdom.</p>
		 			<p>Come see the Abu Simbel Sun Festival! Abu Simbel is one of the premier antiquities in all of Egypt, and twice a year (this festival is also held on 22 October) you can see the sun god statues of the inner sanctuary, normally shrouded in darkness, illuminated by a beam of sunlight. Locals celebrate with traditional Nubian dance, street food (save stomach space for some fresh koshari) and live music outside the temple.</p>

 				<h3>Delectable Cuisines</h3>
		 			<h4>Yogurt Cucumber Dip</h4>
		 				<p>One of the best ways to start off an Egyptian meal is by dipping some naan, bread, or veggies in salatet zabadee. This delicious and refreshing yogurt-cucumber dip is prevalent everywhere in Egypt. It’s light and fresh, and perfect for when the desert heat is at its peak. With its minty edge, this Egyptian recipe pairs with just about everything.</p>

		 			<h4>Egyptian Lentil Soup</h4>
		 				<p>Middle Eastern countries have the best lentil soup. This dish is a staple on tables throughout the land. But each state uniquely does their lentil soup recipe. My recent post on Jordanian recipes has one, but the Egyptian lentil soup recipe has a unique taste.</p>

		 			<h4>Koshari</h4>
		 				<p>There are few recipes more synonymous with Egypt than Koshari. Koshari is the national dish of Egypt. Koshari, which is sometimes spelled kushari, is found everywhere in Egypt, and it’s absolutely delicious.</p>

	 			<h3>Attractions Worth Traveling For</h3>
		 			<h4>Tombs of Kings</h4>
		 				<p>Although the Giza plateau is most closely associated with the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the site was used as early as the First Dynasty of Egypt as evidenced by the tomb of the king Djet which was found toward the edge of the plateau. Evidence of at least one king from the Second Dynasty (Nynetjer) buried at Giza has also been found.</p>

		 			<h4>The Great Pyramids</h4>
		 				<p>The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the pyramid of Cheops, the king's Greek name) is the last remaining of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World and rises to a height of 481 feet (147 metres). The pyramid of Khafre is 471 feet tall(144 metres) and that of Menkaure rises to 213 feet (65 metres). This world famous location is a place everyone should see.</p>

		 			<h4>Great Sphinx of Giza</h4>
		 				<p>The largest and most famous sphinx is the Great Sphinx of Giza, situated on the Giza Plateau adjacent to the Great Pyramids of Giza on the west bank of the Nile River and facing east. The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. While the date of its construction is not known for certain, the general consensus among Egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx bears the likeness of the pharaoh Khafre, dating it to between 2600 and 2500 BCE.</p>
