 				<h3>Welcome to Egypt!</h3>
		 			<p>Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient monuments in the world. It is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE), recent excavations on the plateau have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers' quarters. </p>

		 			<p>Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8 million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the Greater Cairo metropolis.</p>

		 		<h3>Experience the Culture</h3>
		 			<p>In a similar manner, in Egypt’s Middle Kingdom, the Pyramids at Giza acquired cultural significance during the Middle Kingdom, as artifacts of the “golden age.” The cultural memory of the Old Kingdom didn't overwhelm the Middle Kingdom, but the Old Kingdom was viewed as Egypt's "golden age." This veneration of the past continued throughout the New Kingdom.</p>
		 			<p>Come see the Abu Simbel Sun Festival! Abu Simbel is one of the premier antiquities in all of Egypt, and twice a year (this festival is also held on 22 October) you can see the sun god statues of the inner sanctuary, normally shrouded in darkness, illuminated by a beam of sunlight. Locals celebrate with traditional Nubian dance, street food (save stomach space for some fresh koshari) and live music outside the temple.</p>
