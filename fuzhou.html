        <p>Min opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends.</p>

        <p>May 5th is the Dragon-boat Festival and the local traditions include dragon-boat race, Zhongzi wrapping and taking "noon water". Noon water refers to the water taken from the well at noon on the Dragon-boat Festival. All families of Fuzhou used to make tea and liquor with the "noon water" historically because the tea would be particularly mellow with fitness and ill-fortune-dispelling effects. It can also be used to clean the interior of home.</p>
