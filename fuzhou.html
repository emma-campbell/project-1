 				<h3>Welcome to Fuzhou!</h3>
		 			<p>Fuzhou, the capital of southeast province of Fujian, also referred to as Rongcheng (city of Banyang trees), is an important southeast coastal city faces East China Sea as well as a nearest capital city of the country faces the island of Taiwan. Located in the downstream of Min River, Fuzhou is adjacent to Ningde City, Nanping City, Sanming City and Putian City. </p>

		 			<p>The city is heavily populated by Han people, who live harmony with over 20 ethnic minorities of Manchu, Miao, Hui, and so on. Just as its Chinese name Fu (福) implies, it is a city full of good fortunes (Fu). Fuzhou is one of the first open coastal cities in China. Mawei Fuzhou, the cradle of the modern Chinese Navy, has cultivated Chinese shipping culture. It is both a historic and a cultural city with over two-thousand-year of history. Such historical sites as Sanfang Qixiang, Fujian Tulou and Mount Wuyi combining natural scenery and tea culture are waiting for you to explore.</p>

		 		<h3>Experience the Culture</h3>
		 			<p>Besides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (福州話), the prestige form of Eastern Min. Min opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as "Making Seal", "The Purple Jade Hairpin" and "Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi".</p>

		 			<p>May 5 is the Dragon-boat Festival and the local traditions include dragon-boat race, Zhongzi wrapping and taking "noon water". Noon water refers to the water taken from the well at noon (11:00-13:00) on the Dragon-boat Festival. All families of Fuzhou used to make tea and liquor with the "noon water" historically because the tea would be particularly mellow with fitness and ill-fortune-dispelling effects. It can also be used to clean the interior of home.</p>
